# Theory-of-Mind-Inference-Models

These are the homework assignments for UCLA's graduate course Cognitive Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Statistics. 

We use statistical models and computational tools to infer others' beliefs and goals in a variety of 2D grid settings

Bayesian Inference: Implementing the posterior of a distribution from a prior and likelihood

Value Iteration:  a dynamic programming algorithm used for finding the optimal policy for each state action pair in the space. This is for planning the best actions to take in each possible scenario

Goal Inference: a model to infer an agent's goals across time from observed actions; combines value iteration and Bayesian inference

Signaling Policies: a model of how an agent should choose his actions that best communicate his true goal to observers; combines value iteration and likelihood ratios
