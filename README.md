# Theory-of-Mind-Inference-Models

These are the homework assignments for UCLA's graduate course Cognitive Artificial Intelligence in the Department of Statistics. 

We use statistical models and computational tools to infer others' beliefs and goals in a variety of 2D grid settings

Bayesian Inference: Implementing the posterior of a distribution from a prior and likelihood
Value Iteration: a model to infer the values associated with each possible action. This is for planning the best actions to take in each possible scenario
Goal Inference: a model to infer goals across time from observed actions; combines value iteration and Bayesian inference
Signaling Policies: a model of how to act in ways that communicate a goal to others; combines value iteration and likelihood ratios
